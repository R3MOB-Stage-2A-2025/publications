# Art analysis to import publications

This has been written in 2025.

The main objective is to retrieve some information about a publication
and then to store it in the *SQL* database.

## Where to search - Academic Databases

There are a lot of databases around the world that store scientific publications.

Among themselves, there are for instance:

- ***www.science.gov***: a *U.S government* database that contains scientific
research from *U.S federal agencies*.

This one contains more than *200 million pages* of scientific information for free,
and is a gateway to over 2000 scientific websites.
However, it is centered on the *U.S*.

- ***https://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/home*** (*CiteSeer*): centered on computer
and information science.

- ***https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp*** (*IEEE Xplore*): very famous,
however, it requires a subscription.

- ***https://www.springer.com*** (*Springer*): historical database, and also
requires a subscription.


Anyway, you can follow [__this link__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines)
to get a full list of academic databases.


Among those databases, there are the one which are:

- **Not Free**: import a publication from it will be hard.

- **Free**: import a publication from it will be possible.


So the idea is to search for the publication in the right database.
The main idea is to find something that can make request to all those databases.
